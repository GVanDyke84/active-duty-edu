deepdive pwp to assist active duty military members in maximizing their education benefits

# Milestone1

## Feedback

Everything was correct and succinct. The directory structure and HTML were done correct. Persona and usecase were laid out in a way that it was apparent how end users would be interacting with your site. My only concern is scope creep. Try and keep your PWP's scope super focused. If you want to add a couple more pages feel free but do not add more than four pages. If you want to do more than one theme you must create a wirframe for each theme.

Awesome job on your content strategy. It gives a great picture of what your site is going to look like. The scope of the project is perfect.  Your stretch goals are sure to keep you busy after the Bootcamp has ended. Do you have content that can be added to the second table?  If not, I would recommend holding off on the second table until you have content to add. Having a blank table can ruin the UI/UX of the site. Are you planning on having a navbar for the site? I also recommend against the white border. The border would require a lot of time and CSS, if you have any questions feel free to ask Rochelle.  Finally, your directory structure is clean and well organized
