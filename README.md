# Milestone1

## Feedback

Everything was correct and succinct. The directory structure and HTML were done correct. Persona and usecase were laid out in a way that it was apparent how end users would be interacting with your site. My only concern is scope creep. Try and keep your PWP's scope super focused. If you want to add a couple more pages feel free but do not add more than four pages. If you want to do more than one theme you must create a wirframe for each theme.

## Feedback 

Awesome job on your content strategy. It gives a great picture of what your site is going to look like. The scope of the project is perfect.  Your stretch goals are sure to keep you busy after the Bootcamp has ended. Do you have content that can be added to the second table?  If not, I would recommend holding off on the second table until you have content to add. Having a blank table can ruin the UI/UX of the site. Are you planning on having a navbar for the site? I also recommend against the white border. The border would require a lot of time and CSS, if you have any questions feel free to ask Rochelle.  Finally, your directory structure is clean and well organized

## Milestone 2b Feedback
Nice work - this Milestone passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

## Milestone 3 / Final PWP Evaluation
Congratulations on excellent work on your PWP - you've done a great job creating a site that is informative, engaging, beautiful and fully functional. The extra work that you've done to ensure that the mobile view is just right makes a big difference, and demonstrates a good understanding of mobile-first principles. It also looks like your contact form is wired correctly and sends mail from my side - check and see if you received my test message.  

There are some minor technical points and fixes I listed below under **Edits &amp; Suggestions**. Overall, this is a job well done.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Your jQuery and Bootstrap JS are in the wrong order in your &lt;head&gt; tag. Bootstrap JS needs jQuery to come first. Even though you aren't actually using any of the Bootstrap JS, as long as it's in there the dependencies need to be resolved properly.
- The nested &lt;div&gt; structure can use some refinement within your sections. The contact section has an additional container in there, and on some of the above sections you can apply more than one class to a &lt;div&gt; so you won't need so many of them nested.
- Nice work on the `@media` queries to hide content on certain breakpoints. You did do a little more work than you had to though, because Bootstrap has this stuff built-in. http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities
