## Feedback

Everything was correct and succinct. The directory structure and HTML were done correct. Persona and usecase were laid out in a way that it was apparent how end users would be interacting with your site. My only concern is scope creep. Try and keep your PWP's scope super focused. If you want to add a couple more pages feel free but do not add more than four pages. If you want to do more than one theme you must create a wirframe for each theme.
