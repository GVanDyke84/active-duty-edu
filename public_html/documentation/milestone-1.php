			<p>
				Purpose: I have become quite knowledgeable about educational benefits for military members and I intend for this site to serve as an informational resource to guide and help military members looking to maximize the educational benefits available to them.
			</p>

			<p>
				Audience: This site is geared towards active duty military members motivated to complete between 30-50 college credits before they separate from active duty and start using their G.I. Bill benefits.
			</p>

			<p>
				Goal: My goal is twofold. As a developer I plan on showcasing this site as part of my future web developer portfolio which will give potential clients a good idea of my capabilities. I also am in the process of founding a non-profit organization to help active duty military members and veterans maximize their education benefits, and I plan on this site serving as a gateway to future digital products outlining concrete degree paths.
