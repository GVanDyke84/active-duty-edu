			<p>Content Strategy: The top of my page will contain an introduction that details the mission statement of Active Duty Edu and explains the educational opportunities available to military members in a short and very clear manner. The first table that I have will contain the names of the most common CLEP courses that translate into college credits at a wide variety of universities. The second table will be a sample that shows the format of the digital products that my non-profit will be offering in the future. The call to action for my re-captcha mail form will give users the opportunity to receive updates as to when future guides will be released and the opportunity to receive discount codes for these products.</p>
